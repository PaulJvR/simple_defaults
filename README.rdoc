= SimpleDefaults

This is a simple way to provide defaults for active record models with minimal setup.

== Setup

Once the gem is installed, add a defaults method to your model which returns a hash.

   Class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
      def defaults
        { name: 'Jim' }
      end
   end

All types of values are accepted as well as procs and lambdas.
